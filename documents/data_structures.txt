Common Data Structures

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently.

1. Arrays
   - Fixed-size sequential collection
   - Fast access by index: O(1)
   - Insertion/deletion: O(n)

2. Linked Lists
   - Dynamic size with nodes
   - Sequential access: O(n)
   - Insertion/deletion: O(1) with pointer

3. Stacks
   - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
   - Operations: push, pop, peek
   - Use cases: Function calls, undo operations

4. Queues
   - First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
   - Operations: enqueue, dequeue
   - Use cases: Task scheduling, BFS

5. Hash Tables
   - Key-value pairs
   - Average access: O(1)
   - Use cases: Dictionaries, caching

6. Trees
   - Hierarchical structure
   - Binary trees, BST, AVL, Red-Black
   - Use cases: File systems, databases

7. Graphs
   - Nodes connected by edges
   - Directed/Undirected
   - Use cases: Social networks, maps
