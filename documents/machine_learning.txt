Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Learn from labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Find patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learn through trial and error with rewards
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients

Common Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles
